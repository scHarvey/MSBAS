# Notes

## Blockchain Basics

- Data is stored in a distributed ledger - record of every transaction
- Ledger can only be updated via network consensus, therefore information can't be altered it deleted without the knowledge of the network
- "proof of work"
- Bitcoin 3-5 transactions per second

## Not all blockchains are the same

- Public Blockchain networks - bitcoin
- Permissioned Blockchain networks - quorum (ethereum), hyperledger, r3 corda

## When to use Blockchain

- A business process crossed trust boundaries
- Multiple parties work off same source of data
- Intermediary controls a single source of truth
- Process involves low value manual verification steps

## Industry independent

## Insurance use cases

- Claims management
- Fraud detection
